Overview

This tutorial covers all you need to know to ruin your (or someone else's) worlds.

Basics

Warning, you must quit Minecraft completely before running Teeth of Time, or all the ageing will be canceled!

To install the program, simply extract the archive into any location you want.

After installing, run the TeethFrontEnd.exe file located in your extraction directory. The following blank screen should appear: [NO IMAGE]

Select a world from the list on the bottom left. After you pick a world, the program will freeze for a while when it's generating the map. After it's done, you should see something like this: [NO IMAGE]

Select your config from the list on bottom right. You can find descriptions of the configs directly in them or in the Readme.txt file in main Teeth of Time directory

Use the scrollbars to navigate around the map. You can click chunks to select or unselect them, selected chunks have a yellow border. It looks like this: [NO IMAGE]

If you want to age your whole world, simply don't select any chunks and click the "Age selected world" button. This is a very slow process though, so if you want to age all buildings in a world, I recommend you to select them manually, so the program will not waste time on untouched natural chunks.

After you are done, hit the "Age selected world" button. A console window will appear, printing various informations about the process. The process itself will take different amount of time depending on the number of selected chunks.

Wait until the window closes. Hooray! The world (or just a few buildings) is now destroyed, feel free to run it in Minecraft.
