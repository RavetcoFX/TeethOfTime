# --- Teeth of Time HARD_QUALITY config file ---
#
# This config simulates a world that has been abandoned long, long time ago. Rubble is all that remains of human made buildings 
# and nature already took over everything
#
# Note that this is QUALITY config, meaning it tries to achieve the best quality possible at the cost of really long processing time.
